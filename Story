Banana went with Croc. On the way, Croc told Banana that he was gonna kill him and eat him up! Then Banana replied, "Why didn't you say so? I left my liver on the tree! Can you take me back there, then I will come back with my liver". 
Croc believed Banana and took it back to its tree. Banana replied "I am not gonna come with you, you traitor" and stayed there forever.
